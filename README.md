# Chess-x86
A chess game created in assembly x86 16-bit

## Info
I made this as part of my final project in 10th grade.
It's a chess game created in assembly x86 16-bit.

Has move validation, castling, check and checkmate.

## Installation
This needs DOSBox to run.

Download all the files and mount the directory you downloaded them to.
Then inside DOSBox run it using `tasm /zi chess`, `tlink /v chess`, `chess`.

## Instructions
You control a marker that you can move using the `arrow keys`.
Move it to the unit you want to move and press `ENTER` to select.
Then move the marker to the wanted spot and press `ENTER` again to attempt the move.

You can press `ESC` anytime to exit the program.
